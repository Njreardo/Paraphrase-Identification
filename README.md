# Paraphrase-Identification
This is a method proposed to identify paraphrases on a gradient scale. It lemmatizes and stems using the Snowball Stemmer and reduces two inputs to a list of tokens that can be compared between each other and calculates a probability of whether it is a paraphrase or not.
